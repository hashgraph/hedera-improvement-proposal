<h2 id="what-is-a-hip-">What is a HIP?</h2>
<p>HIP stands for <i>“Hiero Improvement Proposal.”</i> These proposals can range from core protocol changes
   to applications, frameworks, or protocols built on top of Hiero’s open-source ledger code. The HIP author
   is responsible for building consensus within the community, documenting dissenting opinions, and tracking
   their HIP through the process outlined below.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-the-hashgraph-algorithm-">What is the Hashgraph Algorithm?</h2>
<p>The <a href="http://www.leemon.com/papers/2016b.pdf">hashgraph consensus algorithm</a> was created by
   <a href="http://www.leemon.com/">Dr. Leemon Baird</a>. Originally, Hedera was a public network built on top
   of this algorithm; later, Hedera donated its codebase to the open-source Linux Foundation project now known
   as Hiero. You can learn more by reading the
   <a href="http://www.leemon.com/papers/2016b.pdf">hashgraph algorithm whitepaper</a>.</p>

<h2 id="purpose">Purpose</h2>
<p>The goal of HIPs is to have a transparent, collaborative place to propose new features, collect community
   input on a particular issue, and document proposals and reasoning in one place. Publishing these proposals
   <a href="https://github.com/hiero-ledger/hiero-improvement-proposals">on GitHub</a> means every revision is
   recorded <a href="https://github.com/hiero-ledger/hiero-improvement-proposals/commits/master">in version history</a>.</p>

<h2 id="process">Process</h2>
<p>See <a href="HIP/hip-1.html">HIP-1</a> for details on the current HIP process.</p>

<h2 id="qualifications">Qualifications</h2>
<p>Each HIP should outline a single key proposal or idea, kept focused to a single subject for clarity.
   A HIP must meet certain minimum criteria: it must be clearly written, describe the proposed enhancement
   completely, represent a net improvement, and (if applicable) include a solid reference implementation
   that does not unduly complicate the network.</p>

<h2>HIP Types</h2>
<p>There are three kinds of HIP:</p>
<ol>
    <li>
      <b>Standards Track</b> &mdash; describes a new feature or interoperability standard for the Hiero
      ecosystem. It requires both a specification and a reference implementation:
      <ol class="ol-lower-latin">
        <li><b>Core:</b> Proposals addressing the hashgraph algorithm, peer-to-peer networking, etc. These features
            are implemented in the Hiero consensus nodes.</li>
        <li><b>Service:</b> These run on top of the core node software and provide functionalities (e.g., file,
            messaging, token, or contract services). Proposals here refine or add to Hiero’s service layer.</li>
        <li><b>Mirror:</b> A mirror node runs software designed to retrieve all, or some, of the records generated
            by the consensus nodes and makes them available in a meaningful way.</li>
        <li><b>Application:</b> Application standards may be used to standardize additional ecosystem software
            (e.g., external contract nodes, multi-sig oracles, enterprise plugins). An example might be a stablecoin
            or NFT contract that relies on the Hiero consensus for trust.</li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Informational</b> &mdash; describes a design issue or general guidelines, but does not propose a new feature.
      These do not necessarily represent consensus recommendations and can be followed or ignored.</li>
    <li>
      <b>Process</b> &mdash; describes or proposes changes to processes for the Hiero community. These often require
      community consensus and are not purely recommendations. Any meta-HIP is considered a Process HIP.
    </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="before-submitting">Before Submitting</h2>
<ol>
    <li><p>Evaluate your idea: consider why you’d like to request changes or improvements and how it benefits
        the broader Hiero community.</p></li>
    <li><p>Check existing proposals to ensure there are no duplicates.</p></li>
    <li><p>Discuss the idea with the Hiero community (for example, on
        <a href="https://discord.com/channels/373889138199494658/813488589773471774">Hedera’s Discord</a> or <a href="https://discord.com/channels/905194001349627914/1289954446712770600">LFDT's Discord</a>) to confirm
        whether it’s original or if it’s been addressed before.</p></li>
    <li><p>Reevaluate your proposal to make sure it is generally applicable and not limited to a single project
        or narrow use case.</p></li>
</ol>

<h5 id="note">Note</h5>
<p>An excellent place to discuss your proposal and get feedback is in the <a
        href="https://github.com/hiero-ledger/hiero-improvement-proposals/issues">issues section of this repository</a>
    or on <a href="https://discord.com/channels/373889138199494658/813488589773471774">Hiero’s Discord server</a>.
    There, you can gather community input and refine the language around your HIP to ensure broad support.</p>
