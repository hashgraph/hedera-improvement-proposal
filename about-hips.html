<h2 id="what-is-a-hip-">What is a HIP?</h2>
<p>HIP stands for &quot;<i>Hiero Improvement Proposal</i>&quot;. These improvement proposals were originally managed by the Hedera Council and we're thus known as Hiero Improvement Proposals. With the transition of the codebase to the open source project Hiero, proposals that meet the criteria for requiring approval are now overseen by the Hiero Technical Steering Committee (TSC). These proposals can range from core protocol changes to applications, frameworks, and protocols built on top of the network and used by the community. The HIP author is responsible for building consensus within the community and documenting dissenting opinions, as well as tracking their HIP through the process outlined below.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-hedera-hashgraph-">What is Hedera Hashgraph?</h2>
<p><a href="https://hedera.com">Hedera Hashgraph</a> is the only public network built on top of <a
        href="http://www.leemon.com/">Dr. Leemon Baird</a>'s <a href="http://www.leemon.com/papers/2016b.pdf">Hashgraph
    consensus algorithm</a>. Hedera goes beyond blockchain to provide the fast, fair, and secure environment needed to
    enable enterprise adoption of distributed ledger technologies. You can learn more about Hedera by <a

<h2 id="purpose">Purpose</h2>
<p>The goal of HIPs is to have a place to propose new features, to collect community thoughts and input on a particular
    issue, and further to document all these subject matters in one place. It's a great way to document these
    discussions and proposals <a href="https://github.com/{{ repo }}">here on GitHub</a>,
    because any <a href="https://github.com/{{ repo }}/commits/master">revisions made on
        these text files will be recorded</a>.</p>
<h2 id="process">Process</h2>
<p>See <a href="HIP/hip-1.html">HIP-1</a> for details on the HIP process.</p>
<h2 id="qualifications">Qualifications</h2>
<p>Each HIP should only be one single key proposal and/or idea. The idea should be focused and only issue to one subject
    matter to be successful. A HIP must meet certain minimum criteria: it must be clear and have a complete description
    of the proposed enhancement, the enhancement must represent a net improvement, the proposed implementation, if
    applicable, must be solid and must not complicate the protocol unduly.</p>

<h2>HIP Types</h2>

<p>There are three kinds of HIP:

<ol>

    <li>A <b>Standards Track</b> HIP describes a new feature or implementation for Hiero. It may also describe an
        interoperability standard that will be supported outside of the official node software stack. The
        Standards Track HIP abstract should include which part of the ecosystem it addresses. Standards Track
        HIPs require a specification and a reference implementation:

        <ol class="ol-lower-latin">
            <li><b>Core</b>: This includes proposals addressing the Hashgraph algorithm, peer-to-peer networking, etc.
                These types of features are implemented on consensus nodes.
            </li>

            <li><b>Service</b>: Services sit on top of the Core node software and provide the functionalities
                that are accessed by users. These currently include the File Service, Consensus Service, Token Service,
                and Smart Contract Service. This type of proposal should be used to add to or improve the service-layer.
                These types of features are implemented on consensus nodes.
            </li>

            <li><b>Mirror</b>: A mirror node runs software designed to retrieve all, or some of the records generated by
                the consensus nodes and make those records available to users in a way that is meaningful,
                reliable, and trustworthy.
            </li>

            <li><b>Application</b>: Application standards may be used to standardize software in the ecosystem
                that aren't mirror or consensus nodes. This includes application network software, external contract
                consensus nodes, multi-sig oracles, persistence mechanisms, enterprise software plugins, etc. An example of
                an Application standard would be the Stablecoin Contract and Non-fungible Token Contract written in Java
                as a layer-2 solution using the Consensus service to maintain trust.
            </li>
        </ol>
    </li>

    <li>An <b>Informational</b> HIP describes a design issue, or provides general guidelines or information to
        the community, but does not propose a new feature. Informational HIPs do not necessarily represent a
        community consensus or recommendation, so users and implementers are free to ignore Informational HIPs or
        follow their direction.
    </li>

    <li>A <b>Process</b> HIP describes a process, or proposes a change to a process. Process HIPs are
        like Standards Track HIPs but apply to areas other than the node and ecosystem software codebases. They may
        propose an implementation, but not to the codebase; they often require community consensus; unlike
        Informational HIPs, they are more than recommendations, and users are typically not free to ignore them.
        Examples include procedures, guidelines, and changes to the decision-making process. Any meta-HIP is also
        considered a Process HIP.
    </li>

</ol>

<h2 id="before-submitting">Before Submitting</h2>
<ol>
    <li><p>Evaluate your idea: consider why you'd like to request changes or improvements, and how it benefits the
        community.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Thoroughly look through those proposals already submitted to ensure there are no duplicates.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Ask the community first if your idea is original, or has already been through the HIP
        process.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Reevaluate your proposal to ensure sure the idea is applicable to the entire community and not just to one
        particular author, application, project, or protocol.</p>
    </li>
</ol>
<h5 id="note">Note</h5>
<p>An excellent place to discuss your proposal and get feedback is in the <a
        href="https://github.com/{{ repo }}/issues">issues section of this repository</a>, or on <a
        href="https://hedera.com/discord">Discord Server</a>; there you can start formalizing the language
    around your HIP and ensuring it has broad community support.</p>
