Hedera Improvement Proposal (HIP) Template

## Summary
Please provide a simple summary of your improvement proposal. 

## Motivation
Please elaborate in a few sentences why this would be an improvement to the existing ecosystem of Hedera software. 

This could be a problem it solves, a use case being developed that could benefit, etc.

## Goals

Please provide a bulleted list of goals you'd like this to accomplish.

* Enable more individuals to get involved with Hedera.
* Standards can be more easily created, benefitting the entire community.

## Non-goals

Please provide a bulleted list of items you're not trying to achieve. 

* Debate or discuss other projects.

## Specification
The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature. 

This is the opportunity to let the community know how you think it should be implemented.

Please include images, graphics, or resources that may help visualize the specification, e.g. UML diagrams, flowcharts, etc. These should be named with the same prefix as the proposal, and checked into the same directory.

## Backwards Compatibility
HIPs that do, or could potentially introduce backwards incompatibilities must include a section outlining potential issues. 

The HIP must explain how the author proposes to deal with these incompatibilities. 

HIP submissions without a sufficient backwards compatibility treatise may be rejected outright.

## Scope and Impact
Please outline all affected properties, whether clients, SDKs, or tools, that would be impacted by this change.

## Test Cases
Where makes sense, please provide outlined test cases or example test cases that would exhibit desired behavior.

## Implementation
What is the implementation plan for this issue? 

Do you already have a solution planned and waiting to be accepted? Show us here!

Does it require Hedera support, or potential funding? Let the community know.
