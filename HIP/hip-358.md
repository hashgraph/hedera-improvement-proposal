## Abstract

Describe the Hedera Token Service (HTS) integration with the Hedera Smart Contract Service (HSCS), allowing contracts to create HTS tokens programmatically.

## Motivation

Allow smart contract developers on Hedera to create HTS fungible and non-fungible tokens through the HTS precompiled contract giving smart contract developers on Hedera the ability to leverage Hedera native token functionality.

## Rationale

HIP-206 already allows token `mint`, `burn`, `associate`, `dissociate` and `transfer` through the HTS precompiled contract. Allowing the creation of tokens via smart contracts is a natural extension of the precompiled contract. It would enable smart contract developers to rely solely on contract code for token management. 

## User stories

As a smart contract developer, I want to be able to create a native HTS fungible token through a solidity contract call.

As a smart contract developer, I want to be able to create a native HTS fungible token with custom fees through a solidity contract call.

As a smart contract developer, I want to be able to create a native HTS non-fungible token through a solidity contract call.

As a smart contract developer, I want to be able to create a native HTS non-fungible token with custom fees through a solidity contract call.

## Specification

### EVM Precompile extension

The [Solidity file for development](../assets/hip-206/solidity/IHederaTokenService.sol) is updated with new types and function signatures that the precompile will respond to. It is included in this HIP by reference.

### New Solidity Types

The following structs have been added to simplify the interface between Solidity and the HTS precompile: 

| Name            | Definition                                                                  |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `KeyValue`      | `(bool, address, bytes, bytes, address)`                                    |
| `Expiry`        | `(uint, address, uint)`                                                     |
| `TokenKey`      | `(uint, KeyValue)`                                                          |
| `HederaToken`   | `(string, string, address, string, bool, uint32, bool, TokenKey[], Expiry)` |
| `FixedFee`      | `(uint32, address, bool, bool, address)`                                    |
| `FractionalFee` | `(uint32, uint32, uint32, uint32, bool, address)`                           |
| `RoyaltyFee`    | `(uint32, uint32, uint32, address, bool, address)`                          |

Most of the struct definitions are a straightforward mapping of their corresponding protobuf message. However, 
there are some notable differences in certain parts, which are explained in-depth in the next several 
subsections.

#### TokenKey and KeyValue

The `TokenKey` struct will be used to define the keys of the newly created token.  


| Field               | Purpose                                                                         |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `uint keyType`      | The type of token key(s) the specified key in the `keyValue` field will act as. |
| `KeyValue keyValue` | The actual key.                                                                 |


Each token key type is mapped to a specific bit in the `uint` field. To specify key types, the user will set 
the corresponding bit in the `uint`. The mappings are as follows:


| Bit         #  | Key Type                                                                     |
|----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1              | Admin key                                                                    |
| 2              | KYC key                                                                      |
| 3              | Freeze Key                                                                   |
| 4              | Wipe key                                                                     |
| 5              | Supply Key                                                                   |
| 6              | Fee Schedule Key                                                             |
| 7              | Pause Key                                                                    |

 * A valid `TokenKey` must have **at least one** of these bits set and no bit 
set that does not have a specified meaning (future updates may add more key types).  
 * Note that a single `TokenKey` can be used to define one, multiple or all 7 of the key types. 
 
As already mentioned, the actual key is specified using the `KeyValue` field. Five different ways of specifying the key 
are supported in this HIP, each corresponding to a field in the `KeyValue` struct:

| Field                           | Corresponding Key-Value                                                                                  |
|---------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `bool inheritAccountKey`        | if set to true, the key of the calling Hedera account will be inherited as the token key                 |
| `address contractId`            | smart contract instance that is authorized as if it had signed with a key                                |
| `bytes ed25519`                 | ED25519 public key bytes                                                                                 |
| `bytes ECDSA_secp256k1`         | compressed ECDSA(secp256k1) public key bytes (33 byte form)                                              |
| `address delegatableContractId` | a smart contract that should be treated as having signed if the recipient of the active message frame. |

Note that exactly **one** of these values should be set. Zero or more than one will be considered invalid.

#### Expiry
As its name suggests, the `Expiry` struct will serve for defining the expiration schedule of the token:

| Field                      | Purpose                                                                                                                                                                                   |
|----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `uint32 second`            | the epoch second at which the token should expire; if an `autoRenewAccount` and  `autoRenewPeriod` are specified, this is coerced to the current epoch second plus the `autoRenewPeriod` |
| `address autoRenewAccount` | ID of an account which will be automatically charged to renew the token's expiration, at `autoRenewPeriod` interval, expressed as a Solidity address                                      |
| `uint32 autoRenewPeriod`   | the interval at which the `autoRenewAccount` will be charged to extend the token's expiry                                                                                                 |

#### HederaToken
`HederaToken` struct defines the basic properties of a Hedera Token, both fungible and non-fungible:

| Field                  | Purpose                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
|------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `string name`          | The publicly visible name of the token. The token name is specified as a Unicode string.                                                                                                                   |
| `string symbol`        | The publicly visible token symbol. The token symbol is specified as a Unicode string.                                                                                                                      |
| `address treasury`     | The account ID will act as a treasury for the token as a solidity address. This account will receive the specified initial supply or the newly minted NFTs in the case of non-fungible token |
| `string memo`          | The memo associated with the token                                                                                                                                                                         |
| `bool tokenSupplyType` | Specified the token supply type - `false` for infinite supply, `true` for finite                                                                                                                           |
| `uint32 maxSupply`     | For tokens of type `FUNGIBLE_COMMON` - the maximum number of tokens in circulation. For tokens of type `NON_FUNGIBLE_UNIQUE` - the maximum number of NFTs (serial numbers) can be minted. |
| `bool freezeDefault`   | The default Freeze status (frozen or unfrozen) of Hedera accounts relative to this token. If true, an account must be unfrozen before it can receive the token                                             |
| `TokenKey[] tokenKeys` | The list of keys to set for the token.                                                                                                                                                                     |
| `Expiry expiry`        | The `Expiry` struct defines the token’s expiry schedule.                                                                                                                                        |

Note that the type of token (fungible or non-fungible) is not specified in the `HederaToken` struct - it is implied 
by the specific precompile function being called (see the functions below).

#### FixedFee
Used to define a fixed fee for the token:

| Field                            | Meaning                                                                                |
|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `uint32 amount`                  | The amount of units the `feeCollector` will receive from the specified denomination.   |
| `address tokenId`                | Specifies the fixed fee should be denominated in the fungible token with the given id |
| `bool useHbarsForPayment`        | Specifies the fixed fee should be denominated in Hbar                                 |
| `bool useCurrentTokenForPayment` | Specifies the fixed fee should be denominated in the token currently being created    |
| `address feeCollector`           | The ID of the account to receive the custom fee, expressed as a solidity address       |

Note that the denomination of the fee depends on the values of `tokenId`, `useHbarsForPayment` and
`useCurrentTokenForPayment`. **Exactly one of the values should be set**.

#### FractionalFee

Used to define a fractional fee for the token:

| Field                  | Meaning                                                                                                |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `uint32 numerator`     | A rational number's numerator, used to set the amount of a value transfer to collect as a custom fee   |
| `uint32 denominator`   | A rational number's denominator, used to set the amount of a value transfer to collect as a custom fee |
| `uint32 minimumAmount` | The minimum amount to assess                                                                           |
| `uint32 maximumAmount` | The maximum amount to assess (zero implies no maximum)                                                 |
| `address feeCollector` | The ID of the account to receive the custom fee, expressed as a solidity address                       |


#### RoyaltyFee

Used to define a royalty fee for the token:

| Field                     | Meaning                                                                                                                                   |
|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `uint32 numerator`        | A fraction's numerator of fungible value exchanged for an NFT to collect as royalty                                                       |
| `uint32 denominator`      | A fraction's denominator of fungible value exchanged for an NFT to collect as royalty                                                     |
| `uint32 amount`           | **Populated only when the fallback fee is desired.** The amount to charge for the fallback fee                                                |
| `address tokenId`         | **Populated only when the fallback fee is desired.** Specifies that the fallback fee should be denominated in the fungible token with the given id |
| `bool useHbarsForPayment` | **Populated only when fallback fee is desired.** Specifies the fallback fee should be denominated in Hbar                                 |
| `address feeCollector`    | The ID of the account to receive the custom fee, expressed as a solidity address                                                          |

* If the user does not want to specify a fallback fee, they must leave `amount`, `tokenId`, `useHbarsForPayment` to 
  their default values
* If the user wants to specify a fallback fee, they must populate the `amount` field and **exactly one** of 
  `tokenId` and `useHbarsForPayment`


### Solidity Function Signatures

Two functions are defined for creating fungible and non-fungible tokens each. One is a simple version with just the required fields and the other is a full version supporting custom fees. The ABI signature and hashes for each call are as follows:

| hash       | effective signature                                                                       | return           |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|
| `7812a04b` | `createFungibleToken(HederaToken, uint, uint)`                                            | `(int, addess)`  |
| `4c381ae7` | `createFungibleTokenWithCustomFees(HederaToken, uint, uint, FixedFee[], FractionalFee[])` | `(int, addess)`  |
| `9dc711e0` | `createNonFungibleToken(HederaToken)`                                                     | `(int, addess)`  |
| `5bc7c0e6` | `createNonFungibleTokenWithCustomFees(HederaToken, FixedFee[], RoyaltyFee[])`             | `(int, addess)`  |

### Precompile Gas Costs

To allow creation of tokens through the precompiled contract, a new mechanism for payment is introduced - precompile calls are partially paid by Hbar value transfers.
There is a base cost of 100,000 Gas for each call to the create functions. Additional Hbar cost must be transferred as `value` to the precompile call. The Hbar price will be calculated using the following formula:

The total cost of HTS Token create through the precompile is equal to the cost of a HAPI Create Token Transaction with similar arguments at that instance plus a 20% premium. 
The Hbars required to be transferred as value in the precompile call will be equal to the total cost required minus the Hbar cost for the base 100,000 gas cost converted into hbar according to the current gas price.

The gas cost is always charged to the HAPI payer. The Hbars transferred as value to the precompile will be charged to the msg.sender for the message frame. Contracts performing a direct call to the precompile will be required to hold Hbar.

Exchange rates might change and consequently Hbar cost for token create might change. The demo contract provided has the means to adjust how much Hbar is transferred as value to the precompile call.

#### Minimum Gas Charge

The gas limit in Ethereum fulfills an essential role in limiting processing throughput, and it also serves in Ethereum Mainnet as a long-term storage cost. This HIP only separates the long-term storage costs but needs to keep the throughput limiting.  Hence some of the precompile costs *must* be paid in gas.

#### Only accepting the exact amount

When a user transfers in via value hbar only the amount needed to pay the transaction is deducted, even if there is excess.  This will simplify accounting in smart contacts that want to maximize hbar payment ability and not needing to program in tracking fluctuating exchange rates.

### Precompile Transaction Records

Child records for Token Create will be created for each precompile call.

## Backwards Compatibility

There are no changes to the protobufs. The changes in the existing HTS precompile only add new features and capabilities and should not impact existing behavior.

## Security Implications

This HIP does not change the implementation of HTS token create, nor does it add new features. What is being added is a new way to call existing functionality. The security posture of the system is expected to remain unchanged.

## How to Teach This

The `IHederaTokenService.sol` interface is well documented and example client code is provided with `TokenCreateContract.sol`.

## Reference Implementation

- Hedera
  Services [PR#2974](https://github.com/hashgraph/hedera-services/pull/2974/)

## Rejected Ideas

### Support for Complex Keys

This HIP only supports simple 1 of 1 and contract keys for authorization and does not support threshold or other complex key structures. There are multiple reasons.  First, solidity does not allow for recursive structure definitions like protobufs do. This recursive definition is essential to the complex key structures supported by the protobuf APIs. Second, allowing even one level of threshold signatures increases the size of the ABI significantly for a feature that would burden uses of the API that do not use threshold key arrangements. It is possible that HTS update calls may be added to the HTS precompile, and it would partially address this shortcoming. In the interim, the protbuf API provides full access to complex keys.
