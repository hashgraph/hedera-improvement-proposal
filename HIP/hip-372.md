## Abstract

Slight modifications of the auto-renewal duration window compared to the original HIP-16.

## Motivation

The original HIP-16 mentions the auto renewal duration between ~81 days and ~92 days. The rationale was to provide a wider window for the auto-renew duration periodfor better flexibility.

## Rationale

Refer to HIP-16.

## User stories

Refer to HIP-16.
  
## Specification

The minimum auto-renew period will be equal to ~30 days (2,592,000 seconds), and the max auto-renew durtaion will remain equal to ~92 days (8,000,001 seconds).
  
## Backwards Compatibility
  
This feature is not enabled on the Mainnet and should therefore be backwards compatible. 

## Security Implications

N/A
  
## How to Teach This

Implementation of this feature will be referenced in release notes, supported by SDKs, as well as supported at docs.hedera.com.


## Reference Implementation
 
The reference implementation change from the original HIP-16 is modifying `ledger.autoRenewPeriod.minDuration` from ~81 days to 30 days.

```
ledger.autoRenewPeriod.maxDuration=8000001 seconds // ~92 days 
ledger.autoRenewPeriod.minDuration=2592000 seconds // ~30 days
```
