## Abstract

The Dynamic Address Book will change the currently manually administered address book for Hedera into an HAPI managed configuration, updatable via signed Hedera transactions on a daily basis without the need to restart the consensus nodes to apply changes across the network.

*Dynamic Address Book - Feature Summary*

- HAPI APIs to facilitate changes to the address book used across the Hedera network
- Automated daily updates to node consensus weighting and SDK service requests
- NMT integration to automate required configuration changes resulting from address book changes

Given the size of the work, the feature will be broken into 2 stages:

**Stage 1 - HAPI Endpoints:** Implement the HAPI endpoints for Address Book management within current Address Book implementation (config.txt, file 0.0.101,& file 0.0.102).  In this phase HAPI endpoints are used to facilitate changes to the Address Book, however those changes are applied through existing, monthly upgrade process.

**Stage 2 -** **Full Implementation** - Full implementation of feature enabling daily changes to a new dynamic Address Book implementation through HAPI endpoints at 24 hour cycles matching Hedera’s staking period. 

This HIP is focused on the HAPI Endpoints phase of the project only.   A second HIP will be released for the Full Implementation stage of the project.


## Motivation

*Problems to Solve*

1. Changes to the address book can only be applied with a node restart requiring maintenance windows to activate Address Book changes locally. 
2. Changes to the address book is a complex, manual process that needs to be replicated across all nodes on the Network within a maintenance window. 
3. Currently node weighting is calculated and applied monthly whereas staking periods occur daily.   

*Feature Benefits:*

- Enables Hedera council and node operators to manage address book automatically.
- Core building block to support eventual support for community and permissionless nodes.
- Enables the rotation of node operators off the Hedera network should it be required as contracts expire.
- NMT integration of local node firewall admin reduces cost & complexity of node operations.
- Staking delegations within a single staking period directly contribute to a node’s consensus weight

## Rationale
The architectural design of Hedera's transaction-driven system was strategically implemented to empower the Hedera council members in overseeing network node participation. Furthermore this framework paves the way for the incorporation of community-led and permissionless nodes in the future. Under this design, independent node operators have the capability to autonomously submit transactions, thus efficiently managing the metadata related to their self-governed nodes.

Adopting a two-phase strategy, this approach facilitated the earlier release of HAPI endpoints, setting the stage for the subsequent deployment of a more automated solution. This phased implementation was key in accelerating both the delivery and utilization of the system.

## User stories

**Personas**

**Council** -  Hedera Council 

**Node Operator** - Administrator of Hedera Consensus Nodes

### User Story 1: Add a New Consensus Node
**As the Council**, we want to submit a NodeCreate HAPI transaction, signed by both the council signature and the node admin key, to add a new consensus node to the Hedera network upon the next maintenance window, so that management of Hedera's Address Book is automated.

**Acceptance:** When the council initiates a NodeCreate HAPI transaction to add a new node with both council and admin signatures, the network acknowledges the transaction and performs the update to the network’s Address Book at the next maintenance window.

### User Story 2: Remove a Consensus Node
**As the Council**, we want to submit a NodeDelete HAPI transaction, signed by either the council signature or the node admin key, to remove a consensus node from the Hedera network upon the next maintenance window, so that management of Hedera's Address Book is automated.

**Acceptance:** When the council submits a NodeDelete HAPI transaction to remove a node, authorized by either the council signature or the node admin key, the network acknowledges the transaction and performs the update to the network’s Address Book at the next maintenance window.

### User Story 3: Modify a Node’s IP Address and Ports
**As a Node Operator**,I want to submit a NodeUpdate HAPI transaction, signed by the node admin key, to modify one or both of an existing node's IP addresses and/or ports, so I can independently perform address book-related node operations.

**Acceptance:** When a Node Operator submits a NodeUpdate HAPI transaction, signed with the node admin key, to modify a node's primary IP address:port or secondary IP address:port, the network acknowledges the transaction and performs the update to the network’s Address Book at the next maintenance window.

### User Story 4: Modify GRPC Proxy Endpoints
**As a Node Operator**, I want to submit a NodeUpdate HAPI transaction, signed by the node admin key, to modify a list of GRPC proxy endpoints supporting either IP and FQDN address formats per entry, so I can independently perform address book-related node operations.

**Acceptance:** When a Node Operator submits a NodeUpdate HAPI transaction, signed with the node admin key, to modify a node's IP address:port or FQDN:port, the network acknowledges the transaction and performs the update to the network’s Address Book at the next maintenance window.
### User Story 5: Modify Node Description
**As a Node Operator**, I want to submit a NodeUpdate HAPI transaction, signed by the node admin key, to modify a node’s description within the Address Book, so I can independently perform address book-related node operations.

**Acceptance:** When a Node Operator submits a NodeUpdate HAPI transaction, signed with the node admin key, to modify a node's associated Description Field, the network acknowledges the transaction and performs the update to the network’s Address Book at the next maintenance window.

### User Story 6: Modify Node’s Public Key
**As a Node Operator**, I want to submit a NodeUpdate HAPI transaction, signed by the node admin key, to modify a node’s public key within the Address Book used for signing, so I can independently perform address book-related node operations.

**Acceptance:** When a Node Operator submits a NodeUpdate HAPI transaction, signed with the node admin key, to modify a node's associated Public Key, the network acknowledges the transaction and performs the update to the network’s Address Book at the next maintenance window.

### User Story 7: Modify Node’s Account ID
**As a Node Operator**, I want to submit a NodeUpdate HAPI transaction, signed by the node admin key, to modify a node’s Account ID within the Address Book, so I can independently perform address book-related node operations.

**Acceptance:** When a Node Operator submits a NodeUpdate HAPI transaction, signed with the node admin key, to modify a node's Account ID, the network acknowledges the transaction and performs the update to the network’s Address Book at the next maintenance window.

### User Story 8: Modify Node’s X509 Certificate Hash
**As a Node Operator**, I want to submit a NodeUpdate HAPI transaction, signed by the node admin key, to modify a node’s X509 certificate hash within the Address Book, so I can independently perform address book-related node operations.

**Acceptance:** When a Node Operator submits a NodeUpdate HAPI transaction, signed with the node admin key, to modify a node's associated X509 certificate hash, the network acknowledges the transaction and performs the update to the network’s Address Book at the next maintenance window.

### User Story 9: Create a New Node as a Node Operator
**As a Node Operator**, I want to submit a NodeCreate HAPI transaction,  signed by both the council signature and the node admin key, to add a new node to the Hedera network upon the next maintenance window, so that I can contribute to the expansion of Hedera's Address Book.

**Acceptance:** When a Node Operator initiates a NodeCreate HAPI transaction to create a new node with both council and node admin signatures, the network acknowledges the transaction and performs the update to the network’s Address Book at the next maintenance window.

### User Story 10: Delete an Existing Node as a Node Operator
**As a Node Operator**, I want to submit a NodeDelete HAPI transaction, signed by either the council signature or the node admin key, to remove a node from the Hedera network upon the next maintenance window, so that I can manage nodes within Hedera's Address Book when necessary.

**Acceptance:** When a Node Operator submits a HAPI transaction to delete a node, signed with either the council signature or the node admin key, the network acknowledges the transaction and performs the update to the network’s Address Book at the next maintenance window.



## Specification

This HIP proposes introducing a new AddressBookService API that empowers node operators to create, delete, and update nodes within the Hedera network. Each operation requires specific transaction authorizations, with signatures from either the Hedera Council, the node admin key, or both, depending on the API action.  Below is a table of the authorization required by endpoint:

| API Action   | Required Signatures                   |
|--------------|---------------------------------------|
| node_create  | Council signature **and** admin key   |
| node_update  | Admin key only                        |
| node_delete  | Admin key **or** council signature    |

```protobuf
service AddressBookService {
    /**
     * A transaction to create a new consensus node in the network.
     * address book.
     * <p>
     * This transaction, once complete, SHALL add a new consensus node to the
     * network state.<br/>
     * The new consensus node SHALL remain in state, but SHALL NOT participate
     * in network consensus until the network updates the network configuration.
     * <p>
     * Hedera governing council authorization is REQUIRED for this transaction.
     */
    rpc createNode (proto.Transaction) returns (proto.TransactionResponse);

    /**
     * A transaction to remove a consensus node from the network address
     * book.
     * <p>
     * This transaction, once complete, SHALL remove the identified consensus
     * node from the network state.
     * <p>
     * Hedera governing council authorization is REQUIRED for this transaction.
     */
    rpc deleteNode (proto.Transaction) returns (proto.TransactionResponse);

    /**
     * A transaction to update an existing consensus node from the network
     * address book.

     * This transaction, once complete, SHALL modify the identified consensus
     * node state as requested.
     * <p>
     * This transaction is authorized by the node operator
     */
    rpc updateNode (proto.Transaction) returns (proto.TransactionResponse);
}


A new Hedera API will be added called NodeCreate, which falls under the AddressBookService category. This function is used by the council or node operator to create a new node. To complete this transaction, both the node operator and a council member must sign it.

```protobuf

     */
    proto.Key admin_key = 7;
}
```

A new Hedera API called NodeDelete will be added under the AddressBookService. This API function is used by either the council or the node operator to delete a node. To perform this transaction, either the node operator or the council need to sign it.

```protobuf
message NodeDeleteTransactionBody {
    /**
     * A consensus node identifier in the network state.
     * <p>
     * The node identified MUST exist in the network address book.<br/>

     * This value is REQUIRED.
     */
    uint64 node_id = 1;
}
```

A new Hedera API called NodeUpdate will be added under the AddressBookService. This function is used by the node operator to update a node. For this transaction only the node operator need to sign it.

```protobuf

The following are some changes to the existing HAPI.

Added three HederaFunctionalities:

```protobuf
enum HederaFunctionality {

	[...]

    /**
    * Create a node
    */
    NodeCreate = 89;

    /**
     * Update a node
     */
    NodeUpdate = 90;

    /**
     * Delete a node
     */
    NodeDelete = 91;
}
```

Added `domain_name` in `ServiceEndpoint`.

```protobuf
message ServiceEndpoint {

	[...]

    /**
     * A node domain name.<br/>
     * This MUST be the fully qualified domain(DNS) name of the node.<br/>

     * When the `ipAddressV4` field is set, the `domain_name` field MUST NOT be set.
     */
    string domain_name = 3;
}
```

Added `node_id` in `TransactionReceipt`:

```protobuf
message TransactionReceipt {

	[...]

    /**
    * In the receipt of a NodeCreate, NodeUpdate, NodeDelete, the id of the newly created node.
    * An affected node identifier.<br/>

```

Each transaction made through NodeService will have a corresponding transaction record. This record will be included in the record stream file for Mirror Nodes to consume.

During stage1, node changes will not be active until the network is upgraded. When the node starts, the Platform still uses config.txt to create an AddressBook, which is then passed to Services. This AddressBook contains the activated nodes in the network. Services use the activated nodes to calculate weight.

When executing the next `freeze` transaction with `freeze_type` set to `PREPARE_UPGRADE`, services will update network configuration according to the pending modifications for all node create, update, or delete transactions since the last upgrade and merge any pending state to active state.

All HIPs that introduce backward incompatibilities must include a section describing these incompatibilities and their severity. The HIP must explain how the author proposes to deal with these incompatibilities. HIP submissions without a sufficient backward compatibility treatise may be rejected outright.

## Admin Key Provisioning and Operations

### View Configured Admin Keys in Address Book
Use the mirror node to query address book and current node admin keys - https://mainnet-public.mirrornode.hedera.com/api/v1/network/nodes

### Initial Provisioning of Node Admin Key
When the Dynamic Address Book feature is enabled on Hedera mainnet, the network must be initialized with default node admin keys, which can be updated to node operator controlled keys over time.  

#### Provisioning by Hedera Council-Controlled Account
- Upon upgrading to a software version that supports the Dynamic Address Book, each consensus node will automatically assign the `0.0.55` addressBookAdmin key to the `admin_key` field for all nodes listed in the Address Book. 
- The `0.0.55` account, controlled by the Hedera Council, ensures a secure starting point for admin key management across the network.

#### Initial Key Update to Node Operator’s Key
- To transition control to the node operator, an initial `NodeUpdate` transaction will be signed by both the Hedera Council and the node operator’s designated admin key.
- This transaction updates the `admin_key` field in the Address Book to reflect the node operator's admin key, transferring ongoing administrative responsibility to the node operator.

### Ongoing Key Operations

#### Creating a New Node
- When a new node is added to the network, the node operator signs a `node_create` transaction using their admin key. 
- This transaction is then submitted to the Hedera Council, which reviews, signs, and submits it to the network, completing the onboarding process for the new node.

#### Updating the Admin Key
- If a node operator needs to update the admin key, they submit a `node_update` transaction signed with both the old and new admin keys.
- This dual-signature approach ensures a seamless transition while maintaining security throughout the key update process.

#### Handling a Lost Admin Key
- In the event that a node operator’s admin private key is lost, the node must be removed from the Address Book by submitting a `node_delete` transaction.
- Following deletion, a new entry for the node can be created using the standard `node_create` transaction, reassigning a new admin key and restoring node operations.


### Mirror node update
The mirror node will process the new Node transactions and service_endpoint information, then return that information through its existing APIs.

The following changes will be made to the GRPC API:
- Update the network service to add `domain_name` and `admin_key`.

The following changes will be made to the REST API:
- Update the `/api/v1/network/nodes` endpoint to return `domain_name` and `admin_key`

## Security Implications

No security issues identified as of yet

## How to Teach This

To educate and facilitate a great customer experience, the following will be required:

- Documentation - Updates to blogs, playbooks, and technical documentation will be required. Additionally previous descriptions of Address Book functionality should be deprecated across existing content.
- Tooling - Updates to tooling to facilitate node operation or transaction construction and submittal will be required to facilitate a great customer experience.
- Transition plan - Since this is transferring responsibility to council members, a formal transition plan should be implemented to ensure a successful hand-off.
