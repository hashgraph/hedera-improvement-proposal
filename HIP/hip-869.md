## Abstract

The Dynamic Address Book will change the currently manually administered address book for Hedera into an HAPI managed configuration, updatable via signed Hedera transactions on a daily basis without the need to restart the consensus nodes to apply changes across the network.

*Dynamic Address Book - Feature Summary*

- HAPI APIs to facilitate changes to the address book used across the Hedera network
- Automated daily updates to node consensus weighting and SDK service requests
- NMT integration to automate required configuration changes resulting from address book changes

Given the size of the work, the feature will be broken into 2 stages:

**Stage 1 - HAPI Endpoints:** Implement the HAPI endpoints for Address Book management within current Address Book implementation (config.txt, file 0.0.101,& file 0.0.102).  In this phase HAPI endpoints are used to facilitate changes to the Address Book, however those changes are applied through existing, monthly upgrade process.

**Stage 2 -** **Full Implementation** - Full implementation of feature enabling daily changes to a new dynamic Address Book implementation through HAPI endpoints at 24 hour cycles matching Hedera’s staking period. 

This HIP is focused on the HAPI Endpoints phase of the project only.   A second HIP will be released for the Full Implementation stage of the project.


## Motivation

*Problems to Solve*

1. Changes to the address book can only be applied with a node restart requiring maintenance windows to activate Address Book changes locally. 
2. Changes to the address book is a complex, manual process that needs to be replicated across all nodes on the Network within a maintenance window. 
3. Currently node weighting is calculated and applied monthly whereas staking periods occur daily.   

*Feature Benefits:*

- Enables Hedera council and node operators to manage address book automatically.
- Core building block to support eventual support for community and permissionless nodes.
- Enables the rotation of node operators off the Hedera network should it be required as contracts expire.
- NMT integration of local node firewall admin reduces cost & complexity of node operations.
- Staking delegations within a single staking period directly contribute to a node’s consensus weight

## Rationale
The architectural design of Hedera's transaction-driven system was strategically implemented to empower the Hedera council members in overseeing network node participation. Furthermore this framework paves the way for the incorporation of community-led and permissionless nodes in the future. Under this design, independent node operators have the capability to autonomously submit transactions, thus efficiently managing the metadata related to their self-governed nodes.

Adopting a two-phase strategy, this approach facilitated the earlier release of HAPI endpoints, setting the stage for the subsequent deployment of a more automated solution. This phased implementation was key in accelerating both the delivery and utilization of the system.

## User stories

**Personas**

**Council** -  Hedera Council 

**Node Operator** - Administrator of Hedera Consensus Nodes


***User Stories:*** 
1. As the Council, we want to submit signed HAPI transactions to add a new consensus node to the Hedera network upon the next maintenance window, so that management of Hedera's Address book is automated.

*Acceptance: When the council initiates a HAPI transaction to add a new node, then the network acknowledges the transaction and performs the update to the network’s Address Book at the next maintenance window.*

2. As the Council, we want to submit signed HAPI transactions to remove a consensus node from the Hedera network upon the next maintenance window, so that management of Hedera's Address book is automated.

*Acceptance: When the council submits a HAPI transaction to remove a node, then the network should acknowledge the transaction and performs the update to the network’s Address Book at the next maintenance window.*

3. As a Node Operator, I want to submit a signed HAPI transaction that modifies one or both of an existing node's IP addresses and/or ports, so I can independently perform address book related node operations.

*Acceptance: When a Node Operator submits a HAPI transaction to modify a node's primary IP address:port or secondary IP address:port, the network acknowledges the transaction and performs the update to the network’s Address Book at the next maintenance window.*

4. As a Node Operator, I want to submit a signed HAPI transaction that modifies a list of GRPC proxy endpoints supporting both IP and FQDN address formats, so I can independently perform address book related node operations.

*Acceptance: When a Node Operator submits a HAPI transaction to modify a node's IP address:port or FQDN:port, the network acknowledges the transaction and performs the update to the network’s Address Book at the next maintenance window.*

5. As a Node Operator, I want to submit a signed HAPI transaction that modifies a node’s description within the Address Book, so I can independently perform address book related node operations.

*Acceptance: When a Node Operator submits a HAPI transaction to modify a node's associated Description Field, then the network acknowledges the transaction and performs the update to the network’s Address Book at the next maintenance window.*

6. As a Node Operator, I want to submit a signed HAPI transaction that modifies a node’s public key within the Address Book used for signing, so I can independently perform address book related node operations.

*Acceptance: When a Node Operator submits a HAPI transaction to modify a node's associated Public Key, then the network acknowledges the transaction and performs the update the network’s Address Book at the next maintenance window.*

7. As a Node Operator, I want to submit a signed HAPI transaction that modifies a node’s Account ID within the Address Book, so I can independently perform address book related node operations.

*Acceptance: When a Node Operator submits a HAPI transaction to modify a node's Account ID, then the network acknowledges the transaction and performs the update the network’s Address Book at the next maintenance window.*

8. As a Node Operator, I want to submit a signed HAPI transaction that modifies a node’s X509 certificate hash within the Address Book, so I can independently perform address book related node operations.

*Acceptance: When a Node Operator submits a HAPI transaction to modify a node's associated X509 certificate hash, then the network acknowledges the transaction and performs the update the network’s Address Book at the next maintenance window.*

## Specification

This HIP proposes the introduction of a new NodeService API that enables a node operator to create, delete, and update nodes. All of these transactions must be signed by the Hedera Council.

```protobuf
service AddressBookService {
    /**
     * A transaction to create a new consensus node in the network.
     * address book.
     * <p>
     * This transaction, once complete, SHALL add a new consensus node to the
     * network state.<br/>
     * The new consensus node SHALL remain in state, but SHALL NOT participate
     * in network consensus until the network updates the network configuration.
     * <p>
     * Hedera governing council authorization is REQUIRED for this transaction.
     */
    rpc createNode (proto.Transaction) returns (proto.TransactionResponse);

    /**
     * A transaction to remove a consensus node from the network address
     * book.
     * <p>
     * This transaction, once complete, SHALL remove the identified consensus
     * node from the network state.
     * <p>
     * Hedera governing council authorization is REQUIRED for this transaction.
     */
    rpc deleteNode (proto.Transaction) returns (proto.TransactionResponse);

    /**
     * A transaction to update an existing consensus node from the network
     * address book.
     * <p>
     * This transaction, once complete, SHALL modify the identified consensus
     * node state as requested.
     * <p>
     * This transaction MAY be authorized by either the node operator OR the
     * Hedera governing council.
     */
    rpc updateNode (proto.Transaction) returns (proto.TransactionResponse);
}
```

A new Hedera API will be added called NodeCreate, which falls under the Node Service category. This function is used by the node operator to create a new node. To complete this transaction, both the node operator and a council member must sign it.

```protobuf
message NodeCreateTransactionBody {
    /**
     * A Node account identifier.
     * <p>

     * The first two entries in this list SHALL be the endpoints published to

     * All other entries SHALL be reserved for future use.
     * <p>
     * Each network may have additional requirements for these endpoints.
     * A client MUST check network-specific documentation for those
     * details.<br/>
     * If the network configuration value `gossipFqdnRestricted` is set, then
     * all endpoints in this list MUST supply only IP address.<br/>
     * If the network configuration value `gossipFqdnRestricted` is _not_ set,
     * then endpoints in this list MAY supply either IP address or FQDN, but
     * MUST NOT supply both values for the same endpoint.
     */
    repeated proto.ServiceEndpoint gossip_endpoint = 3;

    /**

    bytes gossip_ca_certificate = 5;

     */
    proto.Key admin_key = 7;
}

```

A new Hedera API called NodeDelete will be added under the Node Service. This API function is used by the node operator to delete a node. To perform this transaction, both the node operator and a council member need to sign it.

```protobuf
message NodeDeleteTransactionBody {
    /**
     * A consensus node identifier in the network state.
     * <p>
     * The node identified MUST exist in the network address book.<br/>
     * The node identified MUST NOT be deleted.<br/>
     * This value is REQUIRED.
     */
    uint64 node_id = 1;
}
```

A new Hedera API called NodeUpdate will be added under the Node Service. This function is used by the node operator to update a node. For this transaction, both the node operator and council member need to sign it.

```protobuf
message NodeUpdateTransactionBody {
    /**
     * A consensus node identifier in the network state.
     * <p>

The following are some changes to the existing HAPI.

Added three HederaFunctionalities:

```protobuf
enum HederaFunctionality {

	[...]

    /**
    * Create a node
    */
    NodeCreate = 89;

    /**
     * Update a node
     */
    NodeUpdate = 90;

    /**
     * Delete a node
     */
    NodeDelete = 91;
}
```

Added `domain_name` in `ServiceEndpoint`.

```protobuf
message ServiceEndpoint {

	[...]

    /**
     * A node domain name.<br/>
     * This MUST be the fully qualified domain(DNS) name of the node.<br/>
     * This value MUST NOT be more than 253 characters.
     * domain_name and ipAddressV4 are mutually exclusive.
     * When the `domain_name` field is set, the `ipAddressV4` field MUST NOT be set.<br/>
     * When the `ipAddressV4` field is set, the `domain_name` field MUST NOT be set.
     */
    string domain_name = 3;
}
```

Added `node_id` in `TransactionReceipt`:

```protobuf
message TransactionReceipt {

	[...]

    /**
    * In the receipt of a NodeCreate, NodeUpdate, NodeDelete, the id of the newly created node.
    * An affected node identifier.<br/>
    * This value SHALL be set following a `createNode` transaction.<br/>
    * This value SHALL be set following a `updateNode` transaction.<br/>
    * This value SHALL be set following a `deleteNode` transaction.<br/>
    * This value SHALL NOT be set following any other transaction.
    */
    uint64 node_id = 15;

}
```

Each transaction made through NodeService will have a corresponding transaction record. This record will be included in the record stream file for Mirror Nodes to consume.

During stage1, node changes will not be active until the network is upgraded. When the node starts, the Platform still uses config.txt to create an AddressBook, which is then passed to Services. This AddressBook contains the activated nodes in the network. Services use the activated nodes to calculate weight.

When executing the next `freeze` transaction with `freeze_type` set to `PREPARE_UPGRADE`, services will update network configuration according to the pending modifications for all node create, update, or delete transactions since the last upgrade and merge any pending state to active state.

All HIPs that introduce backward incompatibilities must include a section describing these incompatibilities and their severity. The HIP must explain how the author proposes to deal with these incompatibilities. HIP submissions without a sufficient backward compatibility treatise may be rejected outright.

## Security Implications

No security issues identified as of yet

## How to Teach This

To educate and facilitate a great customer experience, the following will be required:

- Documentation - Updates to blogs, playbooks, and technical documentation will be required. Additionally previous descriptions of Address Book functionality should be deprecated across existing content.
- Tooling - Updates to tooling to facilitate node operation or transaction construction and submittal will be required to facilitate a great customer experience.
- Transition plan - Since this is transferring responsibility to council members, a formal transition plan should be implemented to ensure a successful hand-off.

## Reference Implementation

The reference implementation must be complete before any HIP is given the status of “Final”. The final implementation must include test code and documentation.

## Rejected Ideas

TBD

## Open Issues

Stage 2 - Full Dynamic Book Implementation
