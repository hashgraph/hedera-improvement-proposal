## Abstract

This specification proposes a way to add expected decimal information for tokens to
the `TokenMint`, `TokenBurn`, and `TokenWipeAccount` transaction.

## Motivation

The motivation for this HIP is identical to the motivation for [HIP-31](./hip-31.md).
These additional transactions also need the decimal information for use in a hardware wallet.

## Rationale

The below change to token transfer protobuf messages is formulated to incur a minimal operational cost to the network while providing enough information to address hardware wallet security concerns.

## Specification

```java
message TokenMintTransactionBody {
    // [...]

    /**
     * If present, the number of decimals this fungible token type is expected to have. The transfer
     * will fail with UNEXPECTED_TOKEN_DECIMALS if the actual decimals differ.
     */
    UInt32Value expected_decimals = 4;
}

message TokenBurnTransactionBody {
    // [...]

    /**
     * If present, the number of decimals this fungible token type is expected to have. The transfer
     * will fail with UNEXPECTED_TOKEN_DECIMALS if the actual decimals differ.
     */
    UInt32Value expected_decimals = 4;
}

message TokenWipeAccountTransactionBody {
    // [...]

    /**
     * If present, the number of decimals this fungible token type is expected to have. The transfer
     * will fail with UNEXPECTED_TOKEN_DECIMALS if the actual decimals differ.
     */
    UInt32Value expected_decimals = 5;
}

```

## Backwards Compatibility

It shouldn't break existing messages, and will provide needed information for some applications going forward.

## Security Implications

A Ledger hardware wallet user would be able to trust that the fractional display of a token transfer is coming from an on wire message that they are signing with their private key.
