## Abstract

Specifies how to introduce and formalize the concepts of Blocks in Hedera Hashgraph so that it can be used as a foundation on which further interoperability with existing DLT networks and infrastructure can be built.

## Motivation

The concept of blocks is a vital part of the existing Ethereum infrastructure and, as such, the introduction of blocks 
in Hedera can be considered a foundational step towards greater interoperability with EVM based tooling, explorers, exchanges and wallet providers.

## Rationale

Hedera must have a single consistent answer to what a block number is, the hash and which transactions are included in that block number. This is required for two reasons:

1. The Smart Contracts Service to have the context of a `number` and the `hash` of the current block while running the EVM bytecode.
2. Mirror Nodes to have the information in order to implement standard JSON RPC endpoints and be able to answer queries such as:
    1. Getting current block number
    2. Getting block by hash/number
    3. Getting a list of transactions for a block by number/hash
    4. Getting logs based on block number filtering

**Design Goal #1 Minimize Changes**

The Block concept should fit naturally into the existing processes, mechanisms and state updates. It must keep the same responsibilities between consensus, services and mirror nodes.

**Design Goal #2 Lightweight**

The Block concept must not add a lot of complexity and performance overhead to the processing of transactions. It must have minimal impact on the TPS of the network.

Based on the described design goals above, the outlined specification defines that block properties are to be computed and populated at different points in time and by different components of the network, based on their responsibility.

## Specification

**Definitions**

- `block` → `Record file` containing all `Record Stream Objects` for a given time frame. Block times are to be 
  at least `hedera.recordStream.logPeriod` seconds. The genesis block and therefore number (`blockNumber=0`) is 
  considered the stream start date with the first RCD file exported from `services` nodes.
- `block number` → consecutive number of the `Record file` that is being incremented by `1` for every new `Record 
  file`. For already existing networks, this value will be initially bootstrapped through `Mirror Nodes` and after that 
  maintained by services nodes.
- `block hash` → `32 byte` prefix (out of `48 bytes`) of the running hash of the last `Record Stream Object` from 
  the previous `Record File`
- `block timestamp` → Instant of consensus timestamp of the first `transaction`/`Record Stream Object` in the `Record file`.

### Platform

Adapt `TimestampStreamFileWriter` to include `blockNumber` in the `Record File`. Introduce a new field
`firstConsensusTimeInCurrentFile` to be used as a marker when to start a new Record file. Use the field
`lastConsensusTimestamp` to keep track of the last-seen consensus timestamp that was processed. In this way, we can
ensure that we have at least `1000ns`  difference between the last processed transaction before a new file is created.
The unit of time to be used for those 2 properties is `nanos`. In this way if we have a `parent transaction` with at
least one `child precompile transaction` they all will be included in the same `block`/`Record file`. Otherwise, we 
might have a corner case where a `parent transaction` is included in one block, and its `child precompile transaction` 
falls into the next block since it will increase the `consensus timestamp` with `1ns`. Therefore, the algorithm for 
checking whether to start a new file would be the following:

A new `Record Stream Object` enters `addObject(T object)` in `TimestampStreamFileWriter`. It has a consensus timestamp `T`. We create a new file only if both (1) and (2) conditions are met:

1. `T - lastConsensusTime > 1000ns`
2. `T - firstConsensusTimeInCurrentFile > 2s`

or

if `lastConsensusTime` or `firstConsensusTimeInCurrentFile` is `null`

### Services

Services is to update the processing logic of transactions so that it supports logic for determining new record file 
periods, increment `block` number and keep `block` relevant data. The proposed solution specifies a `long` field to be
used for the block number counter, incremented every `hedera.recordStream.logPeriod` seconds. Using a signed 32-bit int
would result in the block number rolling over in 140 years (if current 2-second length is kept). Sub-second block 
lengths would exhaust that number well within the operational lifetime of typical networks. A signed 64 bit integer
provides a much longer timeframe.

**Pseudo-code of the record streaming algorithm**

```markdown
Properties in State:
- blockHashes `map(number -> keccak256(RunningHash))` - stores the hashes of the last 256 blocks
- blockNumber `long` - stores the current block number
- blockTimestamp - `Instant` - stores the timestamp of the block

handleTransaction() {
	...
	bool `newBlock` = shouldCreateNewBlock() {
			if (`currentTS` - `lastConsensusTime` > `1000ns` && `currentTS` - `blockTimestamp` > `hedera.recordStream.logPeriod`) return `true`; else `false`
	}
	if (`newBlock`) {
			`blockHashes[blockNumber] = keccak256(runningHash)` // `runningHash` is stored in `RecordStreaming`. It is a running hash of the last processed RSO
			delete `blockHashes[blockNumber - 256]`
			`blockNumber++`
			`blockTimestamp = currentTS`
	}
	processTransaction(tx)
	...
}

Migration:
`blockNumber = bootstrapLastBlockNumber`, where `bootstrapLastBlockNumber` is a system property added on startup.
`blockTimestamp = bootstrapLastBlockTimestamp`, where `bootstrapLastBlockTimestamp` is a system property added on startup.
```

`number`, `timestamp` and `hash` (map of the 256 most recent blocks) must be available during transaction execution since the following opcodes are to be supported as per the EVM specification:

- `BLOCKHASH` → Accepts the block `NUMBER` for which to return the `hash`. Valid range is the last `256` blocks (not including the current one)
- `NUMBER` → Returns the current block number
- `TIMESTAMP` → Returns the unix timestamp of the current block

**Record File**

Record file version is to be updated to `6`. New `long` property is to be encoded after the `End Object Running Hash` 
and will be `long` `blockNumber`. It is required for `services` to propagate this property to `mirror nodes` since there
are `partial mirror nodes`, that don’t keep the full history from the `first record file`. Due to that, they are unable
to calculate the `block number`, thus all other `block properties`. Block `hash` and `timestamp` will not be included in
the record files, since `block hash` is the `keccak256(End Object Running Hash)` and `timestamp` is 
`1st Record Stream Object`'s consensus `timestamp`.

With the introduction of the new version of `Record Stream Object`s, the respective libraries for state proofs must be updated:

- [https://github.com/hashgraph/hedera-mirror-node/tree/main/hedera-mirror-rest/check-state-proof](https://github.com/hashgraph/hedera-mirror-node/tree/main/hedera-mirror-rest/check-state-proof)
- [https://github.com/hashgraph/hedera-state-proof-verifier-go](https://github.com/hashgraph/hedera-state-proof-verifier-go)

### Mirror Nodes

Based on the updates specified above, the record stream objects will pass all the necessary information for Mirror Nodes to build `Record files`/`blocks` and store enough data about them to be able to answer all block related queries outlined above. 
To do this they will need to read and store the `number` specified in the `Record file`. For 
old record files, they will be derived through a migration process as specified below.

**Historical State / Migration**

`Record files` prior to the introduction of the block properties will not expose the required information. `mirror 
nodes` that have full sync on `testnet` / `mainnet` networks will export a file containing mapping of record file 
consensus end to block number in compressed CSV format:
```
...
1615410294009988000,5548088
1615410300360028000,5548089
```
The file would be generated by executing the SQL `select concat(consensus_end, ',', index) from record_file order by consensus_end asc`
via psql from `mainnet` and `testnet` databases. It will be taken from mirror nodes that have a full history from stream
start. Later, after the block HIP has been implemented, the file with all values up to the first block 
that contains the block numbers will be updated.

A repeatable flyway migration would be added to correct historical record files for partial mirror nodes. 
It would work as follows:
- Skip if not `testnet` or `mainnet`
- Get the last entry in the mapping file and look it up in the `record_file` table.
- If the row's block number matches file then there's nothing to do.
- If the row's block number does not match, update it and update every row before it and after relative to that number.

After the migration, Mirror nodes must be able to answer queries of type:
- Getting block by hash/number
- Getting a list of transactions for a block by number/hash
- Getting logs based on block number filtering

### Block Properties

The following table specifies all `block` properties and at which point they will be computed. Mirror nodes must `hex` encode all properties prior to exposing them through their APIs. This table defines the properties that must be returned through APIs from Mirror Nodes.

| Property | Computed By | Description  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| number | Services | Stored in services state (only the current number) and exported in the record stream. It is the consecutive number of the record file that is being incremented by 1 for every new record file. The number will be initially set in services through the bootstrapping process. It is exposed to the 1) EVM during Transaction Execution through the NUMBER opcode; 2) as a new property in the record file and ingested by mirror nodes. |
| timestamp | Services | Stored in services state (only the last block timestamp) and computed by services. It is the consensusTimestamp of the first transaction in the record file. It is exposed to the 1) EVM during Transaction Execution through the TIMESTAMP opcode; 2) implicitly exported in the record file through the TS of the first transaction in the record file. |
| hash | Services | Stored in services (last 256 blocks). It is the 32 byte prefix of the runningHash of the previous record file. That is the running hash of the last record stream object from the previous record file. It is exposed to the 1) EVM during Transaction Execution through the BLOCKHASH opcode; 2) In the record file as the End Object Running Hash |
| baseFeePerGas | Mirror Node | Always zero, since there is no EIP-1559 style floating block capacity fees in Hedera. |
  | difficulty | Mirror Node | Hardcoded by Mirror Node(s) to hex encoded 0 |
  | extraData | Mirror Node | Hardcoded by Mirror Nodes(s) to 0x |
  | gasLimit | Mirror Node |  Computed by Mirror Node(s). The gas throttle limit per second multiplied by the target block time. |
  | gasUsed | Mirror Node | Computed by Mirror Node(s). The sum of the gasUsed value for all ContractCall and ContractCreate transactions within the block. |
  | logsBloom | Mirror Node | Hardcoded by Mirror Node(s) to the SHA3 computation of empty array
(`0x1dcc4de8dec75d7aab85b567b6ccd41ad312451b948a7413f0a142fd40d49347`) |
  | miner | Mirror Node | Hardcoded by the Mirror Nodes to the 0.0.98 address in the long zero prefix format.  |
  | mixHash | Mirror Node | Hardcoded by Mirror Node(s) to 0x |
  | nonce | Mirror Node | Hardcoded by Mirror Node(s) to hex-encoded 0 |
  | parentHash | Mirror Node | The hash of the previous block. |
  | receiptsRoot | N/A | Hardcoded by Mirror Node(s) to the SHA3 computation of empty array 
(`0x1dcc4de8dec75d7aab85b567b6ccd41ad312451b948a7413f0a142fd40d49347`). It is expected to be used and populated in the future once traceability work is finalised.  |
  | sha3Uncles | Mirror Node | Hardcoded by Mirror Node(s) to the SHA3 computation of empty array (`0x1dcc4de8dec75d7aab85b567b6ccd41ad312451b948a7413f0a142fd40d49347`) |
  | size | Mirror Node | Computed by Mirror Node(s). The size of the record file. |
  | stateRoot | Mirror Node | Hardcoded by Mirror Node(s) to the SHA3 computation of empty array (`0x1dcc4de8dec75d7aab85b567b6ccd41ad312451b948a7413f0a142fd40d49347`) |
  | totalDifficulty | Mirror Node | Hardcoded by Mirror Nodes(s) to hex-encoded 0 |
  | transactions | Mirror Node | Computed by Mirror Node(s) by ingesting the record stream and aggregating RecordStreamObjects of type ContractCall and ContractCreate within the block. |
  | transactionsRoot | Mirror Node | The same value as block `hash` |
  | uncles | Mirror Node | Hardcoded by Mirror Node(s) to empty array [] |

## Backwards Compatibility

The following breaking changes will be introduced with the implementation of the HIP:

- `BLOCKHASH` will no longer return an empty `hash` but the actual `hash` of the block as per the EVM specification.
- `NUMBER` will no longer return the `timestamp` of the `block`, but rather the proper `block` number as specified in the HIP.

## Security Implications

- The specification does not have any security implications.

## How to Teach this

- Respective documentation will be added.

## Reference Implementation

Initial POC in `services`:

- [https://github.com/hashgraph/hedera-services/commit/04501de76f3e649b3f741dd2453c05e2631e7393#diff-1ca5738f0fe42a25f91d641aea2104dd51bec20398ce6c2aa18afde3d5a590d9R417](https://github.com/hashgraph/hedera-services/commit/04501de76f3e649b3f741dd2453c05e2631e7393#diff-1ca5738f0fe42a25f91d641aea2104dd51bec20398ce6c2aa18afde3d5a590d9R417)

## Rejected Ideas

Two iterations have been conducted prior to settling on this approach.

1. Rounds as blocks - the first iteration was proposing that each block is the `consensus round`. It became clear that this approach is not suitable as it implied that multiple blocks are to be issued per second. That would add additional load to infrastructure providers when clients are iterating and going through blocks to query for data.
- Events - the second iteration suggested that `consensus events` are to be defined as `blocks`. The proposal had a much higher cognitive load (1 block = 1 record file is easier to grasp) and it required more changes to the `platform` in order to be implemented. To add on top of that, the same drawback as the `high frequency` blocks was present as well.

## Open Issues

1. Feeding the current values of `contracts.consensusThrottleMaxGasLimit` and `hedera.recordStream.logPeriod` 
   Global Dynamic Properties to Mirror Nodes so that they can compute the `gasLimit` value. The values / gas 
   throttles are available in the network file `0.0.121` but only if they are overriden. In practice Mirror Nodes 
   can update the value for gas/sec (consensusThrottleMaxGasLimit) and block times (log period) however, they do not 
   have a way to feed the current/initial values. Calculating the `gasLimit`:
```markdown
gasLimit = contracts.consensusThrottleMaxGasLimit * hedera.recordStream.logPeriod
```
