## Abstract

This HIP raises the limit on the size of Ethereum transaction data to 128KB, and the limit on the total size of 
Ethereum transactions from 6KB to 130KB. It introduces a new throttle bucket that represents the max bytes-per-second
for accepting "jumbo" transactions larger than 6KB on the network, such that each node gets 1/N of the jumbo throttle 
bucket (using our existing throttle system). This HIP also introduce non-linear pricing for transactions larger 
than 6KB to incentivize smaller sized transactions where possible.

## Motivation

Ethereum and other EVM networks permit up to 128KB of data in a call, whereas Hedera transactions can be no larger than
6KB. Smart contracts that are larger than 6KB have to be uploaded through the Hedera File Service (HFS) through a
`FileCreate` transaction followed by multiple `FileAppend` transactions. Not only does this lead to a poor developer
experience, but it makes operating a JSON-RPC relay difficult and expensive. By permitting transactions to use all
128KB, we improve Ethereum compatibility, developer experience, and make it easier to operate a JSON-RPC relay.

## Rationale

Hedera limits all transactions to a maximum size of 6KB. By limiting the size of transactions, Hedera makes it easier
for clients to get fair access to the network. Ethereum, on the other hand, supports callData sizes of up to 128KB. The
6KB limit is highly problematic for developer experience, and unexpectedly, for network efficiency. This is especially
true when creating contracts, and for oracles sending large amounts of data to the network.

When creating a new smart contract, if the smart contract bytecode and all other bytes for the EthereumTransaction
(including signatures) together exceed 6KB, then the user cannot simply create a contract the way they would on Ethereum
or other networks. They must instead use the Hedera File Service (HFS) to create a file, and then call `ContractCreate`
with that function. This has several challenges:

- The workflow for Hedera is different from Ethereum and other EVM networks
- Uploading a file is expensive, and requires multiple transactions (since the file upload itself is also limited to
  6KB per transaction)
- The file, if not deleted after use, takes up storage space needlessly
- If the smart contract has already been deployed and the user has a lot of callData (such as an oracle with a large
  amount of data), then the user likewise must use HFS to upload the callData in chunks to a file on chain, and then
  issue an EthereumTransaction in such a way as to use that previously uploaded file as the callData.
- Overall deployment / call latency is increased due to the need to upload files and then reference them in the
  Ethereum transactions.

In addition, JSON-RPC relays need to find a business model whereby they can charge users for these HFS transactions.
This creates a poor developer experience. This again breaks the business model of many cross chain relay operators and
makes access to cheap relays difficult.

## User stories

1. As an `EOA` submitting a transaction with large call data I expect the network to accept my transaction and charge me
   the appropriate amount of gas.
2. As a `relay` I want to provide a service for users where they can submit and pay for transactions without increasing
   my own costs or establishing an out-of-band business model for working with users.

## Specification

- Permit Ethereum transaction data to be as large as 128KB
- The entire transaction, including signatures, shall not exceed 130KB
- Increase the price-per-byte non-linearly to encourage smaller transactions
- Institute a network-wide throttle on bytes-per-second for "jumbo" transactions larger than 6KB.

### Execution

A new configurable throttle bucket will be introduced that represents the max bytes-per-second of the network for 
transactions larger than 6KB, such that each node gets 1/N of that throttle bucket (using our existing throttle 
system). If any transaction received exceeds 6KB in size, then it is classified as a "jumbo" transaction. In 
addition to the normal throttle limits, the number of bytes exceeding 6KB will be added to the 'jumbo' throttle
bucket. If the bucket does not have capacity, then the transaction will be rejected.

In addition, the price of the transaction will be increased non-linearly for transactions that exceed 6KB in size. The
actual pricing will be determined by the Hedera Council and specified as part of the network configuration. The price
will **not** affect the gas, but **will** affect the exchange rate between gas and USD.

A JSON-RPC relay *should* calculate the HBAR cost of the transaction and verify the sender has sufficient funds before
sending the transaction to the network to avoid due diligence failure fees.

This HIP only permits the following Ethereum transactions to be "jumbo" transactions:

- `EthereumTransaction` - The `ethereum_data` may be up to 128KB in size.
- `ContractCreate` - the `initcode` may be up to 128KB in size.
- `ContractCall` - the `functionParameters` may be up to 128KB in size.
- `ContractCallLocal` - `functionParameters` may be up to 128KB in size.

Any other transactions exceeding 6KB should be rejected unless specifically allowed by a future HIP.

### Consensus

The configured value for the size of an event in gossip should be set greater than one full-sized jumbo transaction.

### SDK

Today, if a user wants to create a contract with a large amount of callData, they must first upload the callData to a
file in the HFS, and then reference that file in Ethereum transactions. The SDK attempts to manage this complexity
for the user automatically. With this HIP, SDKs should be updated to automatically use jumbo transactions when the
Ethereum byte code exceeds 6KB and is less than or equal to 128KB. The SDK should support an option to use HFS for
callData if the user prefers to manage the complexity themselves.

### Mirror Node

A Mirror Node should not be impacted or require any changes. With the allowed increase in Ethereum transaction size,
the use of HFS for Ethereum data will be lessened. The Mirror Node should be able to handle both jumbo
Ethereum transactions and legacy HFS-based Ethereum transactions.

### Relay

The JSON-RPC relay will be updated to use jumbo transactions. It will no longer use files for large callData.

## Backwards Compatibility

Behavior for the consensus node is fully backwards compatible. The default behavior for SDKs will change to use
jumbo transactions, which may surprise users who are not expecting the change, and the overall cost may be higher than
if the user had used HFS. However, the user can still use HFS if they prefer.

Users of a JSON-RPC relay may see the price in HBAR change as a result of jumbo transactions. They will also see in the
Mirror Node Explorer a single large transaction rather than many small transactions (`FileCreate` and `FileAppend`)
followed by one small `EthereumTransaction`.

## Security Implications

The consensus node will need to take care when ingesting data. Today, with a limit of 6KB, the consensus node can
maintain very small memory buffers for each connection. The consensus node should now be updated to allow "linking"
smaller buffers together when needed for jumbo transactions. This keeps memory usage minimal (vs. if every buffer was
"jumbo" sized).

Fair ordering of transactions requires that transactions are added to gossip events in the order they are
received. Since jumbo transactions occupy more space and events are capped to a configured max size, a large number of
consecutive jumbo transactions can cause the transaction pool in the receiving node to back up.  For this reason a 
bytes/second throttle is necessary to limit the number of jumbo transactions received by a node per second. 

Let `X` be the number of events created per second by a node. Let `E` be the configured max transaction payload per 
event. Let `N` be the number of nodes in the network.  Let `J` be the configured jumbo transaction throttle in bytes 
per second for the entire network.  Then the maximum throttle value allowed for a network should be 
`J < N * (X * Floor(E / 130KB))`. Each node will be able to accept `J/N` bytes per second in jumbo transactions 
without the possibility of a DOS attack through the event creation rate. 

## How to Teach This

With this HIP, the behavior of Ethereum transactions will now match expectations for Ethereum developers. There should
be documentation added to docs.hedera.com to cover this and the documentation for the SDKs should be
updated. The main point to be described to users will be how the jumbo transactions are priced and throttled.
