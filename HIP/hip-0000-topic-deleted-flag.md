## Abstract

This HIP proposes to add a `deleted` flag to the response of a `ConsensusGetTopicInfo`-query.

## Motivation

Knowing if a topic has been deleted is essential for many use cases. Query results for all other entity types contain this information but are missing for topics.

## Rationale

Deleted entities are not immediately removed but marked as being deleted. Queries return these entities. The response for other entity types (e.g., `Account`, `Token`) contains a `deleted` flag that is `true` if the entity has been removed.

The results of `ConsensusGetTopicInfo`-queries do not contain such a flag. This information is crucial for many use cases. For instance, a deleted topic should not be used anymore.

## User stories

As a user, I want to know if a `Topic` has been deleted.

## Specification

The message `ConsensusTopicInfo` is returned as a response to a `ConsensusGetTopicInfo`-query. It contains a deleted flag, which is true if the entity has been removed and false otherwise.

```protobuf
message ConsensusTopicInfo {

    [...]
    
    /**
     * Specifies whether the topic was deleted or not
     */
    bool deleted = 10;
}
```

## Backwards Compatibility

The attribute is additional and can safely be ignored by existing code.

## Security Implications

The new flag imposes no new security risk.

## How to Teach This

Documentation for the `ConsensusGetTopicInfo`-query has to be updated.

## Reference Implementation

_The reference implementation must be complete before any HIP is given the status of “Final”. The final implementation must include test code and documentation._

## Rejected Ideas

An enum `state` with the states `ACTIVE` and `DELETED` would have been extensible. However, we use a `deleted` flag already in similar situations and decided to be consistent.

## Open Issues

None.
