## Abstract

This HIP suggests expanding the current HIP-412 to introduce a detailed Music Metadata Standard for non-fungible tokens (NFTs) in the Hedera ecosystem. It aims to improve how music-related NFTs are represented, used, and interacted with by defining specific metadata attributes for them.

## Motivation

The expansion of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) within the music industry underscores the necessity for a uniform metadata framework tailored for music-related assets. Such standardization would improve the clarity, rights management, and use of music NFTs, leading to a stronger and more effective marketplace.

## Rationale

The Music Metadata Standard enhances the HIP-412 protocol by incorporating attributes tailored to music, including artist name, album title, genre, track length, and others. This enhancement ensures that music NFTs are represented thoroughly, catering specifically to the requirements of the music sector within the Hedera network.

## User stories

As a musician, record label, or NFT creator, my goal is to use a music-focused metadata standard to structure information about my tokenized music so it aligns with the music industry's current metadata conventions. I aim to incorporate elements like ISRC or UPC codes into my NFT metadata, enabling connections to established music databases. Additionally, I seek the flexibility to effectively navigate and categorize the intricacies of digital music.
  
## Specification

The proposed Music Metadata Standard includes the following attributes:

- **Top Level Metadata:** Name, Description, Image, Creator, Format, Type, Category.
- **Properties:** Artist, Album, Creator Account, Compilation, Royalty Type, Sort Name, Artist Type, Duration, UPC.
- **Genre:** Root Genre, Sub Genres.
- **Unlockables:** Unlockable Name, Description, Locked Content, Token Gating.
- **Files:** URI, Type.
- **File Metadata:** Name, Description, Properties.
- **File Metadata Properties:** Streaming Royalties, Royalty Token, Token Gating, Track Number, BPM, Duration, Key, Location Created, Recording Studio, License, Copyright, Label, Master Rights, Publisher Rights, PRO Rights, Release Date, ISRC, Lyrics, Album, UPC, Artist.
- **Credits:** Producer, Mix and Mastering, Composer, Performers, Songwriter.

Below is a detailed breakdown of all elements:

## Backwards Compatibility

This proposal aims to extend HIP-412 without disrupting existing standards. It ensures backward compatibility with current NFT metadata structures.

## Security Implications

The standard does not directly impact security but emphasizes the importance of accurate and immutable metadata for NFTs, which is crucial for rights and royalty management in music assets.

## How to Teach This

Educational materials will be developed to assist artists, record labels, and NFT creators in understanding and implementing the new Music Metadata Standard in their digital assets.

## Reference Implementation

Multiple projects and artists have already incorporated this working music metadata standard. The final standards shown in this HIP may differ from the working standards used in these NFTs. Here are some examples:
* Patches: [View token on HashScan](https://hashscan.io/mainnet/token/0.0.2576108)
* Doerksen & Davenport: [View token on HashScan](https://hashscan.io/mainnet/token/0.0.2997600)
* TuneFM: [Minting tools support standards](https://tune.fm/)

## Rejected Ideas

These NFT music metadata standards were originailly thought of as an update to HIP-412, but it was determined that it's better to consider these standards a child of HIP-412.

## Open Issues

This work has highlighted the need for an update to HIP-412: an optional "category" type identifier.
