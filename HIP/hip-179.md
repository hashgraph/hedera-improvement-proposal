## Abstract

An RPC protocol is described that would allow clients and SDKs to sign
transactions with external programs, devices, and services.

## Motivation

The current Hedera SDK requires that the private keys for accounts be available
and signed in process. One process is to provide the private key in an
environmental variable and use local libraries to produces the signatures. This
is a common approach used in Continuous Build systems and when properly handled
provides good security. However, these keys can unlock large amounts of
real-world value and the needed security posture needs to be better than "good."
Typical high security setups involve hardware devices storing keys or external
services with actual people gate-keeping activity. A process needs to be adopted
that can seamlessly support both developer grade security and full production
security.

## Rationale

As part of a larger DLT ecosystem Hedera should be better served by adopting
existing cross-chain standards. Hence, the utility offered by the Chain Agnostic
Improvement Proposal group relating to RPC interactions was chosen as the main
interface. In particular CAIP-25 and CAIP-27 provide the bulk of the needed
protocol. Some additional definitions of hedera signing operations is needed to
finish the full loop.

## User stories

As an SDK user I want to be able to configure my SDK builds to use an external
signing tool to sign transactions.

As an application I want to be able to use external signing tools at build time
and at runtime.

## Specification

A websocket based proxy server adhering to CAIP-25 and CAIP-27 JSON-RPC calls
will be used to provide signing services. Clients will need to configure and
secure access to this websocket service and then use the provided handshake and
provider request APIs to sign their transactions. Clients will then either need
to submit the signed transaction or verify the submitted transaction was
successfully submitted by the service.

### Signing Proxy Server (CAIP-25 and CAIP-27)

Signing will be supported by an external web socket server. This can either be
the web server of the hardware wallet or external service, or it may be a bridge
between hedera and the specific APIs of the hardware wallet or signing service.
The specific implementation is a detail outside the scope of this spec.

The APIs that will be used will be the CAIP-25 handshake request, the CAIP-27
provider request wrapping the hedera `sign_transaction` or `send_transaction`
call specified in this HIP.

#### Sample call loop

To begin a signing session the SDK or app will initiate a web socket connection
to the proxy. A CAIP-25 handshake call must be successfully made at that point.
Zero or more signing requests can be made via the CAIP-27 provider request. The
session is ended by closing the websocket connection.

If the app wishes to change the signing key then a separate websocket connection
to the proxy server will need to be maintained in parallel or serialized.

### Hedera signing JSON-RPC calls

Two JSON-RPC methods are defined for use in the CAIP-27 provider
request, `hedera_signTransaction` and `hedera_sendTransaction`.

#### `hedera_signTransaction`

This JSON-RPC method signs a transaction that can be submitted to the network
via the existing SDK methods. It is expected there will be some operation on the
other end to process the signature, possibly including user approval.

There is one required and one optional parameter: The required parameter
is `transaction`, which will be the hex encoded protobuf message that is being
signed. The optional parameter is `pubKey`, which is the public key of the
desired signature. If the signer has more than one key this is a required field.
If `pubKey` is specified the signature returned MUST be that of the specified
key.

>     }

>         "pubkey": "f0e0d0c0b0a09876543210"
>     }
> }
> ```

The successful return will have one field `signature` that will be the hex
encoded signature that can be added to the `sigMap` field of
a `SignedTransaction` method. The transaction is not returned and must be the
transaction of the request.

>     "result": {

>     }
> }
> ```

There are a number of error messages corresponding to standard failure
scenarios. If the call fails for some other reason the client MAY provide any
sensible error code and description

* When user disapproves of the specific transaction
  * code = 5099
  * message = "User disapproved requested transaction"
* When the specified public key is not available
  * code = 5098
  * message = "Public key not available"
* When wallet rejects the transaction before presenting it to the user
  * code = 5199
  * message = "Transaction rejected by wallet provider"
* When the wallet has multiple private keys that could sign, but the user did
  not specify a key
  * code = 5198
  * message = "Multiple public keys available"
  * data (optional) = Array of hex encoded public keys available to sign

#### `hedera_sendTransaction`

This JSON-RPC method signs a transaction and then submits it to the hedera
network. It is expected there will be some operation on the other end to
process the signature, possibly including user approval.

There is one required and one optional parameter: The required parameter
is `transaction`, which will be the hex encoded protobuf message that is being
signed. The optional parameter is `pubKey`, which is the public key of the
desired signature. If the signer has more than one key this is a required field.
If `pubKey` is specified the signature returned MUST be that of the specified
key.

>     "method": "hedera_sendTransaction",

>         "transaction": "fedcba9876543210"
>     }
> }
> ```

>         "pubkey": "f0e0d0c0b0a09876543210"
>     }
> }
> ```

The successful return will have one field `transactionHash` that will be the hex
encoded transaction hash. This identifier can be used in Mirror Node APIs to
access the submitted transaction.

## Backwards Compatibility

These APIs do not displace the existing functionality provided by in-process
signing, they exist as an additional option. Applications will continue to be
able to sign transactions with a private key provided to them.

## Security Implications

This protocol allows applications to remove the concerns about handling a
signing key within the application and delegate that responsibility to an
external program. This should improve the general security posture of an app.

Special attention needs to be paid to the endpoint's security. There are many
techniques such as firewalls, interface binding, and TLS certificates, and JSWT
to ensure the identity and provenance of the use fo the endpoints. Those are
orthogonal to the protocol of the request and response itself.

<!--
## How to Teach This

For a HIP that adds new functionality or changes interface behaviors, it is helpful to include a section on how to teach users, new and experienced, how to apply the HIP to their work.

## Reference Implementation

The reference implementation must be complete before any HIP is given the status of “Final”. The final implementation must include test code and documentation.
-->

## Rejected Ideas

Direct interaction with Hardware Wallets was rejected because it is not portable
and durable as a standard for interactions. Specific applications and build
systems may adopt this approach, but it is difficult to standardize in a
portable fashion.

Using gRPC as the protocol is desirable, but cross chain standards have settled
on JSON-RPC (via WebSockets or HTTP post) as a standard for interaction. The use
of protocol buffers to encode the transactions is still a requirement as all 
chains have some opaque and chain specific data structure to sign.
