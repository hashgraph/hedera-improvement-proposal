## Abstract

This HIP proposes a modification to the Hedera Consensus Service (HCS) to:
 - Enable setting the `autoRenewAccountId` when creating a `TopicCreateTransaction` even if an Admin Key is not present during Topic Creation.


## Motivation

Currently, when a Topic ID is created, the `autoRenewAccountId` is not automatically set to the account that initiated the transaction. Additionally:

- It is only possible to set this field when an Admin Key is generated with the Topic. For topics that are created with the intention of being more "immutable," this is a risk.
- Up until HIP-874 (https://github.com/hashgraph/hedera-improvement-proposal/pull/883/files), it was not easy to verify if a Topic was successfully created with an Autorenew Account Id, leading to more unexpected errors for users.

This proposal seeks to simplify the process for users by making the auto-renewal mechanism seamless, eliminating the need for Admin Keys to be present when setting the `autoRenewAccountId`. 

## Rationale

The proposed change enables expected user interactions with HCS and ensures consistency in managing topic renewals. 

## Specification

### Automatic Setting of autoRenewAccountId in SDKs

When a new Topic ID is created, the `autoRenewAccountId` shall be automatically set in the SDKs to the account ID that creates the transaction, providing additional flexibility for when an Admin Key is not set.

### Backwards Compatibility

This feature has no issues with backwards compatibility.

### Transaction Changes

The current implementation allows for the `autoRenewAccountId` to be specified during topic creation only when an Admin Key is present. This proposal does not remove this capability, but in the SDKs, adds an automatic default to the transaction creator's account if not explicitly set, and the capability to set an `autoRenewAccountId` even when Admin Key is not present during creation.

## Backwards Compatibility

This feature has no issues with backwards compatibility.

## Implementation

The Hedera node software will be updated to support assignment of the `autoRenewAccountId` during the topic creation process even if an Admin Key is not present.

## Drawbacks

There should be no drawbacks to this approach. Only furture topic ids will be allowed to set `autoRenewAccountId` without needing to also set the Admin Key. 

## Alternatives

- **Future Rent Logic Adjustments:** If rent is enabled for TopicId Entities and a Topic Id was created before this HIP, rent would be charged to the `payer_account_id` of the Topic Id when an Autorenew Account Id was not present.
